# Why another batch renaming tool?
NB Renamer started as a personal tool to help tidy up file names, especially the downloads ;).
There are many free bulk renaming software on the internet, but like most users, I just need an easy-to-use gadget, not an aircraft cockpit.
Bearing the KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid) principle, NB Renamer may not have the most complicated functions, but I hope you'll find it useful in your toolbox and enjoy its

- **Minimal & Dynamic interface**
![Seq](public/help/seq.png)
- **Intuitiveness and interactivity**
  - Auto preview changes before the real renaming
  - Populate the values for you at the mouse cursor's position or selection

- **Green and NO Ads, and other [features](public/help/releases.md)**...

Or you can directly [contact me](mailto:nbrenamer@gmail.com). I'm keen to hear your feedback and make it better!

# Your support is appreciated!
NB Renamer is currently a [freeware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware) (Free as in Beer), but it'll also become open source (Free as in Speech) in the future.  
I hope you'll find it useful at times and appreciate your kindness to [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bl5s3cxyr)<a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bl5s3cxyr"><img src="./public/icon/buymeacoffee.png"></a> to support this software.
